snyk.api.token=

# Your Snyk Organization ID.

# Path to an SSL Certificate for Snyk API in PEM format.
#snyk.api.sslCertificatePath=

# If you are using a proxy, you must provide both Hostname/IP and port.
#snyk.http.proxyHost=
#snyk.http.proxyPort=

# If set to "true", automatically trusts all certificates used by Snyk API.
# Accepts: "true", "false"
# Default: "false"
#snyk.api.trustAllCertificates=false

# By default, if Snyk API hasn't responded within a duration of 60 seconds, the request will be cancelled.
# This property lets you customise the timeout duration in milliseconds.
# Default: "60000"
#snyk.api.timeout=60000

# =====================
# Scanner Configuration
# =====================

# Scan result expiry. When the most recent scan was made within this time frame,
# filtering respects the previous result. Beyond that time, a new Snyk Test request is made.
# When this property is set to 0, the plugin triggers a test each time an artifact is accessed.
# Default: 168 (1 week)
#snyk.scanner.frequency.hours=168

# How much to extend the scan result expiry when a Snyk Test request fails.
# In case there is a Snyk request error when the next test is due,
# this parameter allows the plugin to use the previous test result when deciding whether to block access.
# Beyond this extended deadline, the result of filtering will depend on the snyk.scanner.block-on-api-failure param.
# Default: 24 hours (1 day)
#snyk.scanner.extendTestDeadline.hours=24

# By default, if Snyk API fails while scanning an artifact for any reason, the download will be allowed.
# Setting this property to "true" will block downloads when Snyk API fails.

#snyk.scanner.block-on-api-failure=false
